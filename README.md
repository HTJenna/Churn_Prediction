# Churn_Prediction
The project focuses on predicting which customers are likely to churn, utilizing data from a US-based telecommunications company 
that includes demographics,usage, and account information. By applying data science skills, tools, and the CRISP-DM framework, 
the goal is to understand customer churn. This insight can help businesses mitigate the risk of churn and prevent revenue losses.

Below are some of the questions asked during the EDA.
1)	Which group of people are likely to churn ?
2)	Which cities have a high churn rate?
3)	Which group of citizens is most likely to have a specific type of contract?
4)	How long have people who are likely to churn been using the service?
