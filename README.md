# Churn_Prediction
The project focuses on predicting which customers are likely to churn, utilizing data from a US-based telecommunications company 
that includes demographics,usage, and account information. By applying data science skills, tools, and the CRISP-DM framework, 
the goal is to understand customer churn. This insight can help businesses mitigate the risk of churn and prevent revenue losses.

Below are some of the questions asked during the EDA.
1)	Which group of people are likely to churn ?
2)	Which cities have a high churn rate?
3)	Which group of citizens is most likely to have a specific type of contract?
4)	How long have people who are likely to churn been using the service?

In this prediction the accuracy, recall, precision ans F1-Score flactuates as the dataset is very small and due to class inbalance.

Libraries used :

Scikit-learn - Utilized for machine learning tasks.

matplotlib - used for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations

Seaborn - library for creating visually appealing and informative statistical graphics.

python libraries(Pandas,Numpy) - Leveraged for data manipulation and various other tasks.

Jupyter Notebook: For interactive coding (optional)


Installation instructions and Usage Guide:

-Install Python (preferably version 3.7 or later) can be downloaded from python.org. 

-Install requred library packages for data manipulation, machine learning, and visualization.

  pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib.

- Install any editor such as Jupyter notebook, Visual Studio code etc.
